  abstract  = {Increasing and variable traffic demands due to triple play services pose significant Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) resource management challenges for service providers. Managing subscriber expectations via consolidated IPTV quality reporting will play a crucial role in guaranteeing return-on-investment for players in the increasingly competitive IPTV delivery ecosystem. We propose a fault diagnosis and problem isolation solution that addresses the IPTV monitoring challenge and recommends problem-specific remedial action. IPTV delivery-specific metrics are collected at various points in the delivery topology, the residential gateway and the Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer through to the video Head-End. They are then pre-processed using new metric rules. A semantic uplift engine takes these raw metric logs; it then transforms them into World Wide Web Consortium's standard Resource Description Framework for knowledge representation and annotates them with expert knowledge from the IPTV domain. This system is then integrated with a monitoring visualization framework that displays monitoring events, alarms, and recommends solutions. A suite of IPTV fault scenarios is presented and used to evaluate the feasibility of the solution. We demonstrate that professional service providers can provide timely reports on the quality of IPTV service delivery using this system.},

  abstract  = {Large-scale websites are predominantly built as a service-oriented architecture. Here, services are specialized for a certain task, run on multiple machines, and communicate with each other to serve a user's request. An anomalous change in a metric of one service can propagate to other services during this communication, resulting in overall degradation of the request. As any such degradation is revenue impacting, maintaining correct functionality is of paramount concern: it is important to find the root cause of any anomaly as quickly as possible. This is challenging because there are numerous metrics or sensors for a given service, and a modern website is usually composed of hundreds of services running on thousands of machines in multiple data centers.

This paper introduces MonitorRank, an algorithm that can reduce the time, domain knowledge, and human effort required to find the root causes of anomalies in such service-oriented architectures. In the event of an anomaly, MonitorRank provides a ranked order list of possible root causes for monitoring teams to investigate. MonitorRank uses the historical and current time-series metrics of each sensor as its input, along with the call graph generated between sensors to build an unsupervised model for ranking. Experiments on real production outage data from LinkedIn, one of the largest online social networks, shows a 26\% to 51\% improvement in mean average precision in finding root causes compared to baseline and current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring and troubleshooting distributed systems is notoriously difficult; potential problems are complex, varied, and unpredictable. The monitoring and diagnosis tools commonly used today -- logs, counters, and metrics -- have two important limitations: what gets recorded is defined a priori, and the information is recorded in a component- or machine-centric way, making it extremely hard to correlate events that cross these boundaries. This paper presents Pivot Tracing, a monitoring framework for distributed systems that addresses both limitations by combining dynamic instrumentation with a novel relational operator: the happened-before join. Pivot Tracing gives users, at runtime, the ability to define arbitrary metrics at one point of the system, while being able to select, filter, and group by events meaningful at other parts of the system, even when crossing component or machine boundaries. We have implemented a prototype of Pivot Tracing for Java-based systems and evaluate it on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster comprising HDFS, HBase, MapReduce, and YARN. We show that Pivot Tracing can effectively identify a diverse range of root causes such as software bugs, misconfiguration, and limping hardware. We show that Pivot Tracing is dynamic, extensible, and enables cross-tier analysis between inter-operating applications, with low execution overhead.},

  abstract  = {Once failures occur in a cloud datacenter accommodating a large number of virtual resources, they tend to spread rapidly and widely, impacting on many cloud users (tenant owners). One of the best ways to prevent a failure from spreading in the system is identifying signs of the failure before its occurrence and deal with it proactively before it causes serious problems. Although several approaches have been proposed to predict failures by analyzing past system message logs and identifying the relationship between the messages and the failures, it is still difficult to automatically predict the failure for several reasons such as various types of log message formats or time gaps between message pattern learning and application of the identified patterns in real systems. Based on this understanding, we propose a new failure prediction method in this paper which learns message patterns as the signs of failure automatically by classifying messages by their similarity without depending on their format and re-Iearning of message patterns in frequently-changed configurations. We implemented our failure prediction method and evaluated it by using system log data recorded in an actual cloud datacenter. The experimental result shows that our approach predicted failures with 80\% precision and covered 90\% of failure occurrences.},

  abstract  = {Anomaly detection (AD) sensors compute behavior profiles to recognize malicious or anomalous activities. The behavior of a host is checked continuously by the AD sensor and an alert is raised when the behavior deviates from its behavior profile. Unfortunately, the majority of AD sensors suffer from high volumes of false alerts either maliciously crafted by the host or originating from insufficient training of the sensor. We present a cluster-based AD sensor that relies on clusters of behavior profiles to identify anomalous behavior. The behavior of a host raises an alert only when a group of host profiles with similar behavior (cluster of behavior profiles) detect the anomaly, rather than just relying on the host's own behavior profile to raise the alert (single-profile AD sensor). A cluster-based AD sensor significantly decreases the volume of false alerts by providing a more robust model of normal behavior based on clusters of behavior profiles. Additionally, we introduce an architecture designed for the deployment of cluster-based AD sensors. The behavior profile of each network host is computed by its closest switch that is also responsible for performing the anomaly detection for each of the hosts in its subnet. By placing the AD sensors at the switch, we eliminate the possibility of hosts crafting malicious alerts. Our experimental results based on wireless behavior profiles from users in the CRAWDAD dataset show that the volume of false alerts generated by cluster-based AD sensors is reduced by at least 50\% compared to single-profile AD sensors.},

Yet few datacenters are automated this way in practice, due in part to well-founded skepticism about whether the simple models often used in the research literature can capture complex real-life workload/performance relationships and keep up with changing conditions that might invalidate the models. We argue that these shortcomings can be fixed by importing modeling, control, and analysis techniques from statistics and machine learning. In particular, we apply rich statistical models of the application's performance, simulation-based methods for finding an optimal control policy, and change-point methods to find abrupt changes in performance. Preliminary results running aWeb 2.0 benchmark application driven by real workload traces on Amazon's EC2 cloud show that our method can effectively control the number of servers, even in the face of performance anomalies.},

  abstract = {Residential buildings in northern China have annually consumed over 4.4\% of China's total energy by space heating, and the proportion is still growing. A key task when making an energy conservation guide is to identify the parameters that have significant impacts on the building heating energy consumption. The traditional methods for this task, such as optimization-simulation, regression, and artificial neural network (ANN) methods, either require considerable amounts of computing capacity and time, or present the results in complex equations or networks that are difficult to understand. This study proposed a data mining approach to analyze the correlation between a building's heating energy consumption and its physical & heating system parameters, based on a field survey of 5615 households from 116 buildings in Tianjin, a city in China's cold winter climate region. The box-plot method was used to detect outliers in the original database, and determine the attributes. The information gain ratio calculation algorithm was applied to rank the correlation between the heating energy consumption per unit area (HECPA) and 16 (19) attributes on both household and building scales. Finally, the C4.5 decision tree classifier was used to model the correlations and output the classification rules. The results indicated that the window heat-transmission coefficient and type of heating-terminal were the two attributes that most significantly affected the heating energy consumption on both scales. According to the classification rules, a higher window heat-transmission coefficient for a household usually resulted in a higher HECPA level, while buildings that used floor heating as their heating-terminals had a high probability of consuming more heating energy than those that used radiators. Nevertheless, a higher window-to-wall ratio may not necessarily result in more heating energy consumption. The main contribution of this study was the development of a promising approach that could assist in quickly understanding the hidden correlation between heating energy consumption and related factors through a massive amount of collected data.},

The key factors influencing the convenience stores energy consumption and the influence intensity order can be explored by data attributes selection. The numerical prediction model for energy consumption is built by applying regression analysis and classification techniques. The optimization thresholds of various influential factors are obtained. The different cluster data are compared by using clustering analysis to verify the correlation between the factors influencing the convenience stores energy consumption characteristic. The implicit knowledge of energy consumption characteristic obtained by the aforesaid analysis can be used to (a).

Most deep learning approaches require to centralize the multi-datacenter data for performance purpose. In practice, however, it is often infeasible to transfer all data to a centralized data center due to not only bandwidth limitation but also the constraints of privacy regulations. Model averaging is a conventional choice for data parallelized training, but its ineffectiveness is claimed by previous studies as deep neural networks are often non-convex. In this paper, we argue that model averaging can be effective in the decentralized environment by using two strategies, namely, the cyclical learning rate and the increased number of epochs for local model training. With the two strategies, we show that model averaging can provide competitive performance in the decentralized mode compared to the data-centralized one.

The proposed model was developed to ease generalization to other buildings, by making use of readily available measurements of a comparatively small number of variables related to water source heat pump operation in the building environment. The six models are - tree bagger, Gaussian process regression, multiple linear regression, bagged tree, boosted tree and neural network. The input parameter comprised the prescribed period, external climate data and the diverse load conditions of water source heat pump. The output was electrical power consumption of water source heat pump. In this study, simulations were conducted in three sessions - 7-day, 14-day and 1-month from 8th July to 7th August 2016. The forecast precisions of data mining models were measured by diverse indices. The performance indices which were used in assessing the prediction performance were - mean absolute error, coefficient of correlation, coefficient of variation, root mean square error, mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. The mean absolute percentage error results for 7-day future energy demand forecasting from tree bagger, Gaussian process regression, bagged tree, boosted tree, neural network and multiple linear regression were 3.544\%, 0.405\%, 1.703\%, 1.928\%, 2.592\% and 13.053\%, respectively. Moreover, when the proposed data mining model performance was compared with the existing studies, the mean absolute percentage error of 2.515\% was found out for the first session, 7-day. The results also showed that the six models were efficient in foreseeing the abnormal behavior and future cooling and heating load demand in the building environment.},

  abstract = {Building operations account for the largest proportion of energy use throughout the building life cycle. The energy saving potential is considerable taking into account the existence of a wide variety of building operation deficiencies. The advancement in information technologies has made modern buildings to be not only energy-intensive, but also information-intensive. Massive amounts of building operational data, which are in essence the reflection of actual building operating conditions, are available for knowledge discovery. It is very promising to extract potentially useful insights from big building operational data, based on which actionable measures for energy efficiency enhancement are devised. Data mining is an advanced technology for analyzing big data. It consists of two main types of data analytics, i.e., supervised and unsupervised analytics. Despite of the power of supervised analytics in predictive modeling, unsupervised analytics are more practical and promising in discovering novel knowledge given limited prior knowledge. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the current utilization of unsupervised data analytics in mining massive building operational data. The commonly used unsupervised analytics are summarized according to their knowledge representations and applications.

  abstract = {While online optimal control is regarded as an efficient tool to improve the operating efficiency of air conditioning, traditional optimal control strategies utilize the so-called time-driven optimization (TDO) scheme which triggers actions by “time”. Although it works well for simple air conditioning systems, several limitations are encountered when systems become more and more complex. Since TDO is a periodic scheme, it may not be suitable or efficient to react to stochastic operational changes. Recently, in order to solve those limitations, the event-driven optimization (EDO) scheme has been proposed, in which actions are triggered by “event”. However, previous studies only used prior knowledge to discover important events, which could only find events for general systems, and might not comprehensive because human prior knowledge is limited after all. Moreover, prior-knowledge-based method is able to discover new knowledge. Thus, this paper presents an effective data mining approach to discover the hidden knowledge in massive data set for EDO in building air conditioning systems. Results shown that data-mining-based EDO achieves a higher energy saving with reduced computation load, in comparison with the traditional TDO. Since the data mining approach can help to automate the process of finding critical events and event threshold, it also improves the practicability of EDO.},

At present, automatic meter reading systems have been installed in DH systems. These systems make hourly or even minutely meter readings available at low cost. However, the sheer quantity and complex of the data poses a challenge at various levels for traditional data analysis approaches. Data mining is a promising technology and is used to automatically extract valuable knowledge hidden in large amounts of data. To investigate the potential application of descriptive data mining techniques in DH systems, this study proposes a method based on descriptive data mining to improve the energy performance of DH substations. The proposed method consists of five steps: data cleaning, data transformation, cluster analysis, association analysis, and interpretation/evaluation. Data cleaning and transformation are implemented to improve data quality and transform data into forms that are appropriate for mining. Cluster analysis is performed to identify distinct operating patterns of substations. Based on each pattern, association analysis is then adopted to discover the unsuspected knowledge in the form of rules. Interpretation/evaluation is performed to select and interpret potentially useful rules. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed method is used to analyze the datasets obtained from an automatic meter reading system at two substations in the DH system in Changchun, China. This application reveals that the method can effectively extract potentially useful knowledge and thereby provide essential guidance for the fault detection and operation optimization of DH substations.},

Massive amounts of building operational data are being collected and available for knowledge discovery. Advanced data analytics are urgently needed to fully realize the potential of big building operational data in enhancing building energy efficiency. Data mining (DM) technology, which is renowned for its excellence in discovering hidden knowledge from massive datasets, has attracted increasing attention from the building industry. The rapid development in DM has provided powerful mining methods for extracting insights in various knowledge representations. Gradual pattern mining is a promising technique for identifying interesting patterns in big data. The knowledge discovered is represented as gradual rules, i.e., ‘the more/less A, the more/less B’. It can bring special interests to building energy management by highlighting co-variations among building variables. This paper investigates the usefulness of gradual pattern mining in analysing massive building operational data. Together with the use of decision trees, motif discovery and association rule mining, a comprehensive mining method is developed to ensure the quality and applicability of the knowledge discovered. The method is validated through a case study, using the real-world data retrieved from an educational building in Hong Kong. It shows that novel and valuable insights on building operation characteristics can be obtained, based on which fault detection and optimal control strategies can be developed to enhance building operational performance.},

Sensor data are collected and contextualized in reference to the building information model that captures the geometric and functional characteristics of the data center, which will be used as inputs of continuous simulations aiming to predict real-time thermal performance of server working environment. Comparing the simulation results against historical performance data via machine learning and data mining, facility managers can quickly pinpoint thermal hot zones and actuate intervention procedures to improve energy efficiency. This BIM-WSN integration also facilitates smarter power management by capping runtime power demand within peak power capacity of data centers and alerting power outage emergencies.

  abstract     = {Data centers are a significant and growing component of electricity demand in the United States. This paper presents a bottom up model that can be used to estimate total data center electricity demand within a region as well as the potential electricity savings associated with energy efficiency improvements. The model is applied to estimate 2008 U.S. data center electricity demand and the technical potential for electricity savings associated with major measures for IT devices and infrastructure equipment. Results suggest that 2008 demand was approximately 69 billion kilowatt-hours (1.8percent of 2008 total U.S. electricity sales) and that it may be technically feasible to reduce this demand by up to 80percent (to 13 billion kilowatt-hours) through aggressive pursuit of energy efficiency measures. Measure-level savings estimates are provided, which shed light on the relative importance of different measures at the national level. Measures applied to servers are found to have the great},

  abstract = {Data centres are large energy consumers today, and their consumption is expected to increase further, driven by the growth in cloud services. The large monetary cost and the environmental impact of this consumption have motivated operators to optimize data centre management. We argue that one of the underlying reasons for the low-energy utilization is the lack of visibility into a data centre's highly dynamic operating conditions. Wireless sensor networks promise to remove this veil of uncertainty by delivering large volumes of data collected at high spatial and temporal fidelities. The paper summarizes data centre operations in order to describe the parameters that a data centre sensing network should collect and motivate the challenges that such a network faces. We present technical approaches for the problems of data collection and management and close with an overview of a data centre genome, an end-to-end data centre sensing system.},

  abstract = {Today's large data centres are the computational hubs of the next generation of IT services. With the advent of dynamic smart cooling and rack level sensing, the need for visual data exploration is growing. If administrators know the rack level thermal state changes and catch problems in real time, energy consumption can be greatly reduced. In this paper, we apply a cell-based spatio-temporal overall view with high-resolution time series to simultaneously analyze complex thermal state changes over time across hundreds of racks. We employ cell-based visualization techniques for trouble shooting and abnormal state detection. These techniques are based on the detection of sensor temperature relations and events to help identify the root causes of problems. In order to optimize the data centre cooling system performance, we derive new non-overlapped scatter plots to visualize the correlations between the temperatures and chiller utilization. All these techniques have been used successfull},

In order to predict growth or set effective goals, it is important to choose the correct metric and be aware of their expressivity and potential limitations. As cloud based services and the use of ICT infrastructure are growing globally, continuous monitoring and measuring of data center facilities are becoming essential to ensure effective and efficient operations. In this work, we explore the diverse metrics that are currently available to measure numerous data center infrastructure components. We propose a taxonomy of metrics based on core data center dimensions. Based on our observations, we argue for the design of new metrics considering factors such as age, location, and data center typology (e.g., co-location center), thus assisting in the strategic data center design and operations processes.},
